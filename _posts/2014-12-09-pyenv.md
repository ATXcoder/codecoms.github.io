## Discovering Pyenv

Before learning Python, I had been working with Ruby over a period of 3 years
having the opportunity to participate in a great [Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/tampa-rb)
as well my professional role as a Development Operations Engineer at [LivingSocial](https://www.livingsocial.com).

I soon discovered [Sam Stephenson](https://github.com/sstephenson/)'s GitHub project [Rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv).

Sam is an A+ contributor in my book and has developed other great projects such as the Bash
unit test framework [BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats).

Rbenv hooks into your interactive shell environment by manipulating `PATH` and using
[shims](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#understanding-shims)
which are a set of shell scripts and functions which intercept the invocation of executables such as `ruby`
`gem`, or whatever a package installs as an executable, (e.g. `rake`).

With these shims, Rbenv can conditionaly execute different versions of Ruby based
on the shell environment or by consulting the file `.ruby-version` which can set this based on
a current directory path.

This allows you to install many versions of Ruby and easily isolate the version to a specific project's code base.

This is a great pattern (as well as utilizing [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)) for limiting a majority of
the side-effects encountered when developing or deploying multiple applications in the same execution environment.


I was perusing through a friend of mine's [Github account](http://github.com/brlindblom) recently and stumbled upon a Python
version of Rbenv entitled [Pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) from [Yuu Yamashita](https://github.com/yyuu).

Knowing the power of Rbenv I was excited to give this version a try.

## Setting up a Build Environment

Since Pyenv builds many of it's versions of python from source, its important to have a compiler
as well as associated build tools and libraries installed previous to setting it up in your shell.

This article does not address the MacOS but you will likely need to install
[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from Apple App Store (free) which is their compiler and
associated tools.

I ran the following script on a [Fedora 20 Linux](http://fedoraproject.org) desktop to install
the tools and libraries needed for a basic build environment (your mileage may vary):

`~/install-workstation-dev-env.sh` (run as root or via `sudo`):

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    cd /var/tmp

    packages="gcc gcc-c++ tar binutils readline-devel sqlite-devel zlib-devel \
      openssl-devel expat-devel postgresql-devel mysql-devel texinfo curl git"

    yum -y install ${packages} && yum clean all

    yaml_url=http://pyyaml.org/download/libyaml/yaml-0.1.5.tar.gz
    ffi_url=ftp://sourceware.org/pub/libffi/libffi-3.1.tar.gz

    for url in ${yaml_url} ${ffi_url}; do
      extract_dir="$(basename $url .tar.gz)"
      curl -sL $url | tar zxf -
      cd ${extract_dir} && ./configure && make install
      cd .. && rm -r ${extract_dir}
    done

## Setting up Pyenv

### Configure the shell

The official installation instructions are
[here](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/blob/master/README.md#installation)
however I wrote the following snippet which initiates an install if
Pyenv  does not exist.

In addition there is an optional cleanup function which strips any references
from the environment to cleanly initialize new Pyenv settings or location.

Add to `/.bash_profile` ...

    pyenv_cleanup() {
      export PATH=$(echo $PATH \
        | perl -p -e "s{(^|:)${PYENV_ROOT:-$HOME/.pyenv}[^:]*}{}g; s{^:}{};")
      for v in ${!PYENV_*}; do unset $v; done
      unset VIRTUAL_ENV
    }

    pyenv_init() {
      export PYENV_ROOT="${PYENV_ROOT:-$HOME/.pyenv}"
      local pyenv="git://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git"
      local pyenv_virtualenv="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv.git"

      [[ -d ${PYENV_ROOT} ]] || git clone ${pyenv} ${PYENV_ROOT}

      [[ -d ${PYENV_ROOT}/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv ]] \
        || git clone ${pyenv_virtualenv} ${PYENV_ROOT}/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv

      export PATH="${PYENV_ROOT}/bin:$PATH"
      eval "$(pyenv init -)"
      eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
    }

    pyenv_init

### Source the environment

    user@sys:~$ source ~/.bash_profile

### Install Python

Use `pyenv install --list` to list all versions available for install.

In this example we will install python 2.7.8.

    user@sys:~$ pyenv install 2.7.8
      Downloading Python-2.7.8.tgz...
      -> https://yyuu.github.io/pythons/74d70b915....2f825f26cb2b93abd20fdda56b557
      Installing Python-2.7.8...
      Installing setuptools from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py...
      Installing pip from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py...
      Installed Python-2.7.8 to /home/u/.pyenv/versions/2.7.8
      etc...

### Enter the project directory and create a Virtualenv

    user@sys:~$ mkdir -p ~/src/myproject && cd ~/src/myproject

Create a virtualenv by running `pyenv <python_version> <virtualenv_name>`.

In this example we use command line substitution to automatically set the virtualenv name
to the project's root directory.

    user@sys:~/src/myproject$ pyenv virtualenv 2.7.8 $(basename $(pwd))
      New python executable in /home/u/.pyenv/versions/myproject/bin/python
      Installing setuptools, pip...done.
      Installing setuptools from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py...
      Downloading https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-7.0.zip
      Extracting in /tmp/tmpTWQYyY
      Now working in /tmp/tmpTWQYyY/setuptools-7.0
      Installing Setuptools
      running install
      running bdist_egg
      running egg_info
      writing requirements to setuptools.egg-info/requires.txt
      etc...

To automatically set the virtualenv every time you enter the project directory,
use `pyenv local <virtualenv>` to create a `.python-version` file.

    user@sys:~/src/myproject$ pyenv local myproject
      pyenv-virtualenv: activate myproject

Here are some example command to run to see how virtualenv is set via
a `.python-version` file and how it activates and de-activates as you
navigate in and out of the project directory.

    user@sys:~/src/myproject$ cat .python-version
      myproject

    user@sys:~/src/myproject$ pyenv version
      myproject (set by /home/u/~/src/myproject/.python-version)

    user@sys:~/src/myproject$ cd ~
      pyenv-virtualenv: deactivate myproject

    user@sys:~$ cd -
      /home/u/~/src/myproject
      pyenv-virtualenv: activate myproject

### Install any required packages

    user@sys:~/src/myproject$ pip install <package...>

or:

    user@sys:~/src/myproject$ pip install -r requirements.txt
