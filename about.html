This site was inspired out of the passions of a team of computing enthusiasts (Federico and Kevin) who wanted to create a place to share and express their love for software development, architecture, design, and computing in general. It is a place to share in the exhilaration of a venture well done or as a harbor to gain encouragement and strength when the sometimes terrifying sea of silicon becomes to much.

We don't want to categorize ourselves as simply a web development or programming site. We'd like to talk about everything that inspires us in the magical world of coding and computing.
